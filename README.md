Tkinter-Ventures
====================

The following three projects are both games written in Python using the Tkinter importation for graphics.

Palindromica - November 2014 

An original game where a user is to expose palindromes from a string of digits.
Digits or spaces can be clicked on order to expose an odd/even palindrome whose length is auto-detected.
Includes an elegant, simplistic design and instructions screen.

Bonkers - July 2014	

An original game where a user creates barriers to deflect a ball away from black holes and into a goal.
Includes a level-creator mode where multiple levels can be designed by moving objects and saving their positions.
Level-saving and high score-saving made possible with File I/O methods.

2048 with AI - May 2014	

A fully functional replica of the popular “2048” game that can be played using the arrow keys.
Includes a heuristic artificial intelligence with the ability to solve the board any time the user tells it to.
A base tile which is not hard-coded so that it can be changed to a number other than the default, 2.

Thank you for your interest,
