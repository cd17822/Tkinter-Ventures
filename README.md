Tkinter-Masterpieces
====================

The following two projects are both games written in Python using the Tkinter importation for graphics.

Bonkers - July, 2014	
An original game where a user creates barriers to deflect a ball away from black holes and into a goal.
Includes a level-creator mode where multiple levels can be designed by moving objects and saving their positions.
Level-saving and high score-saving made possible with File I/O methods.

2048 with AI - May, 2014	
A fully functional replica of the popular “2048” game that can be played using the arrow keys.
Includes a heuristic artificial intelligence with the ability to solve the board any time the user tells it to.
Also, the base tile is not hard-coded (can be changed to a number other than 2).

Thank you for your interest,
